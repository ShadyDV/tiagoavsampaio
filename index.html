   <p id="welcome"> Welcome!</p>
<br>
<br>


<div>
 <p>My name is Tiago Sampaio. I am a 21-year-old, International Business, as well as Business and Management graduate, who
 currently lives in Vila Nova de Famalicão, Portugal. At the moment, I am extremely interested in seeking for opportunities in Germany.</p>
 <br>
 <p>Throughout my life as a student, at University of Minho, I have gained knowledge from various areas inside and outside of Management, including the fields of Economics, Law, Social Responsibility and so much more. In the way I look at it, I see this as an advantage, given the fact that it gives me a broader and clearer vision on how firms and markets must behave according to their conditions and needs. It was with my post-graduation in Business and Management that I developed a deeper understanding of the theories and dynamics of the art of managing.</p>
 <br>
 <p>The opportunity of taking on an internship, in which I worked in a knitted fabric business, while taking my
 post-graduation, undoubtedly put all the theory I was learning into practice. It also further improved some fundamental
 skills, as for example, communication, organization and leadership. Additionally, I have worked as a consultant in two projects, during the final semester of my bachelor’s degree. One with
my fellow Portuguese colleagues and the other with a diverse group of partners from all over the world.</p>
 <br>

 <p>I consider myself to be a proactive, detailed-oriented person, who is never afraid to learn new skills for the sake of my job and my
 personal growth. Furthermore, I am a strong believer in “leading by example”.</p>
